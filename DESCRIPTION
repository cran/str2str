Title: Convert R Objects from One Structure to Another
Version: 0.2.0
Authors@R: person("David", "Disabato", email = "ddisab01@gmail.com",
    role = c("aut","cre"))
Description: Offers a suite of functions for converting to and from
    (atomic) vectors, matrices, data.frames, and (3D+) arrays as well
    as lists of these objects. It is an alternative to the base R
    as.<str>.<method>() functions (e.g., as.data.frame.array()) that
    provides more useful and/or flexible restructuring of R objects.
    To do so, it only works with common structuring of R objects (e.g.,
    data.frames with only atomic vector columns).
